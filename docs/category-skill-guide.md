## Tool Alignment Rule

When skills require runtime actions, use `ohmymkt_*` tools so outputs are persisted in `.ohmymkt/`.

Do not bypass runtime tools for plan/gate/cycle/report operations.

## Planning vs Execution Skills

- Planning skills: market analysis, positioning, strategy framing
- Execution skills: content production, publishing, cycle operations

Always keep plan approval before high-cost execution.
