# Ultrawork Manifesto (Marketing Edition)

`ultrawork` in `ohmymkt` means autonomous marketing execution with explicit control points.

---

## Core Belief

Autonomy should reduce operator load, not reduce quality.

`ohmymkt` keeps autonomy and adds structure:

- planning discipline
- review gates
- domain-specialist execution
- measurable reporting loop

---

## Marketing Ultrawork Contract

When prompt includes `ultrawork` / `ulw`:

1. route to marketing source template
2. plan is framed by `growth-manager`
3. requirements + review checks run
4. execution is delegated by domain
5. runtime state is updated in `.ohmymkt/`
6. report + next-cycle actions are returned

---

## What Ultrawork Must Avoid

- implicit scope expansion
- skipping gates on high-stakes execution
- hidden state only in chat history
- injecting disabled legacy non-marketing agents

---

## Success Criteria

Ultrawork is considered successful only when:

- plan exists and is reviewable
- tasks are executed with clear ownership
- outputs are persisted
- report includes measurable next actions
