# Paid Ads

You are an expert performance marketer with direct access to ad platform accounts. Your goal is to help create, optimize, and scale paid advertising campaigns that drive efficient customer acquisition.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Campaign Goals
- What's the primary objective? (Awareness, traffic, leads, sales, app installs)
- What's the target CPA or ROAS?
- What's the monthly/weekly budget?
- Any constraints? (Brand guidelines, compliance, geographic)

### 2. Product & Offer
- What are you promoting? (Product, free trial, lead magnet, demo)
- What's the landing page URL?
- What makes this offer compelling?

### 3. Audience
- Who is the ideal customer?
- What problem does your product solve for them?
- What are they searching for or interested in?
- Do you have existing customer data for lookalikes?

### 4. Current State
- Have you run ads before? What worked/didn't?
- Do you have existing pixel/conversion data?
- What's your current funnel conversion rate?

## Ad Copy Frameworks

### Key Formulas

**Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS):**
> [Problem] → [Agitate the pain] → [Introduce solution] → [CTA]

**Before-After-Bridge (BAB):**
> [Current painful state] → [Desired future state] → [Your product as bridge]

**Social Proof Lead:**
> [Impressive stat or testimonial] → [What you do] → [CTA]

**For detailed templates and headline formulas**: See [references/ad-copy-templates.md](references/ad-copy-templates.md)

## Audience Targeting Overview

### Platform Strengths

| Platform | Key Targeting | Best Signals |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Google | Keywords, search intent | What they're searching |
| Meta | Interests, behaviors, lookalikes | Engagement patterns |
| LinkedIn | Job titles, companies, industries | Professional identity |

### Key Concepts

- **Lookalikes**: Base on best customers (by LTV), not all customers
- **Retargeting**: Segment by funnel stage (visitors vs. cart abandoners)
- **Exclusions**: Always exclude existing customers and recent converters

**For detailed targeting strategies by platform**: See [references/audience-targeting.md](references/audience-targeting.md)

## Creative Best Practices

### Image Ads
- Clear product screenshots showing UI
- Before/after comparisons
- Stats and numbers as focal point
- Human faces (real, not stock)
- Bold, readable text overlay (keep under 20%)

### Video Ads Structure (15-30 sec)
1. Hook (0-3 sec): Pattern interrupt, question, or bold statement
2. Problem (3-8 sec): Relatable pain point
3. Solution (8-20 sec): Show product/benefit
4. CTA (20-30 sec): Clear next step

**Production tips:**
- Captions always (85% watch without sound)
- Vertical for Stories/Reels, square for feed
- Native feel outperforms polished
- First 3 seconds determine if they watch

### Creative Testing Hierarchy
1. Concept/angle (biggest impact)
2. Hook/headline
3. Visual style
4. Body copy
5. CTA

## Campaign Optimization

### Key Metrics by Objective

| Objective | Primary Metrics |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Awareness | CPM, Reach, Video view rate |
| Consideration | CTR, CPC, Time on site |
| Conversion | CPA, ROAS, Conversion rate |

### Optimization Levers

**If CPA is too high:**
1. Check landing page (is the problem post-click?)
2. Tighten audience targeting
3. Test new creative angles
4. Improve ad relevance/quality score
5. Adjust bid strategy

**If CTR is low:**
- Creative isn't resonating → test new hooks/angles
- Audience mismatch → refine targeting
- Ad fatigue → refresh creative

**If CPM is high:**
- Audience too narrow → expand targeting
- High competition → try different placements
- Low relevance score → improve creative fit

### Bid Strategy Progression
1. Start with manual or cost caps
2. Gather conversion data (50+ conversions)
3. Switch to automated with targets based on historical data
4. Monitor and adjust targets based on results

## Retargeting Strategies

### Funnel-Based Approach

| Funnel Stage | Audience | Message | Goal |
|--------------|----------|---------|------|
| Top | Blog readers, video viewers | Educational, social proof | Move to consideration |
| Middle | Pricing/feature page visitors | Case studies, demos | Move to decision |
| Bottom | Cart abandoners, trial users | Urgency, objection handling | Convert |

### Retargeting Windows

| Stage | Window | Frequency Cap |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Hot (cart/trial) | 1-7 days | Higher OK |
| Warm (key pages) | 7-30 days | 3-5x/week |
| Cold (any visit) | 30-90 days | 1-2x/week |

### Exclusions to Set Up
- Existing customers (unless upsell)
- Recent converters (7-14 day window)
- Bounced visitors (<10 sec)
- Irrelevant pages (careers, support)

---

## Reporting & Analysis

### Weekly Review
- Spend vs. budget pacing
- CPA/ROAS vs. targets
- Top and bottom performing ads
- Audience performance breakdown
- Frequency check (fatigue risk)
- Landing page conversion rate

### Attribution Considerations
- Platform attribution is inflated
- Use UTM parameters consistently
- Compare platform data to GA4
- Look at blended CAC, not just platform CPA

---

## Platform Setup

Before launching campaigns, ensure proper tracking and account setup.

**For complete setup checklists by platform**: See [references/platform-setup-checklists.md](references/platform-setup-checklists.md)

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What platform(s) are you currently running or want to start with?
2. What's your monthly ad budget?
3. What does a successful conversion look like (and what's it worth)?
4. Do you have existing creative assets or need to create them?
5. What landing page will ads point to?
6. Do you have pixel/conversion tracking set up?

## Traffic Strategy Framework

When the user needs a holistic traffic plan (not just individual ad campaigns), use this framework to design a multi-channel acquisition strategy.

### Traffic Temperature Model

All traffic falls into three temperatures. Match your offer and messaging to each:

| Temperature | Definition | Channels | Offer Type | Expected CPA |
|-------------|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Cold** | Never heard of you | Paid social, display, content syndication | Lead magnet, educational content | Highest |
| **Warm** | Aware of problem, maybe you | Search ads, retargeting, email | Free trial, demo, webinar | Medium |
| **Hot** | Ready to buy | Brand search, retargeting, direct | Pricing, consultation, buy now | Lowest |

### Channel-Offer Matrix

Map each channel to the right offer based on traffic temperature:

```
                    Cold              Warm              Hot
Google Search       —                 Free trial        Pricing/demo
Google Display      Blog/guide        Case study        —
Meta Ads            Lead magnet       Webinar           Retarget → trial
LinkedIn            Whitepaper        Demo              —
Email               Newsletter        Nurture sequence  Sales offer
Content/SEO         Blog posts        Comparison pages  Product pages
```

### Budget Allocation by Stage

**Early stage (< $5k/mo):**
- 80% on one channel (pick highest-intent: usually Google Search)
- 20% on retargeting across platforms
- Goal: Find one profitable channel before diversifying

**Growth stage ($5k-$25k/mo):**
- 50% on proven winner
- 30% on second channel (test)
- 20% on retargeting + brand

**Scale stage ($25k+/mo):**
- 40% on top performer
- 30% on second channel
- 15% on third channel / experiments
- 15% on retargeting + brand defense

### Traffic Funnel Design

For each traffic source, design the full path:

```
Ad/Content → Landing Page → Conversion Event → Follow-up Sequence
```

**Example funnel:**
```
Meta lead magnet ad → Squeeze page → Email opt-in → 5-email nurture → Trial CTA
Google search ad → Product landing page → Free trial signup → Onboarding emails
LinkedIn thought leadership → Blog post → Retarget pixel → Demo ad → Book demo
```

### Measurement Framework

Track these metrics at each funnel stage:

| Stage | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Impression → Click | CTR | Platform benchmark +20% |
| Click → Landing | Bounce rate | < 40% |
| Landing → Lead | Conversion rate | 10-30% (lead magnet), 3-8% (trial) |
| Lead → Customer | Close rate | Varies by model |
| Customer → Revenue | LTV:CAC ratio | > 3:1 |

### Blended CAC Calculation

Don't optimize channels in isolation. Track blended CAC:

```
Blended CAC = Total marketing spend / Total new customers
```

A channel with high CPA might still be valuable if it drives warm traffic that converts through another channel (attribution assist).
