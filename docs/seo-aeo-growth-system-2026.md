# ohmymkt Final Version: General SEO + AEO Growth System (2026 Execution Manual)

Version: 2026.2  
Applicable scope: Generic startup execution model  
Target framework: Outcome-driven organic growth system that expands organic traffic and answer-engine visibility  
Architecture baseline: Reuses orchestration principles from `/Users/henry/PARA/[01] Projects/Vibe/ohmymkt/oh-my-opencode-fork/docs/guide/understanding-orchestration-system.md` and maps roles to clear company functions (`Planner`, `Plan Reviewer`, `Execution Manager`, and domain specialists).

---

## Executive Summary

This manual is not a strategy memo. It is an operating system.

Every execution cycle follows three fixed stages:

1. Startup readiness and gate pass (`Go/No-Go`).
2. Full execution system (dual-track operation + module SOP + weekly/monthly/quarterly loops).
3. End-state acceptance (visibility, quality, and business contribution).

The core rule is strict: **visibility track and quality track must run in parallel**.  
Single-track growth is treated as incomplete execution.

---

## How to Use This Manual

### Read Order

1. `docs/guide/overview.md`
2. `docs/guide/installation.md`
3. `docs/guide/understanding-orchestration-system.md`
4. This manual

### Execution Order

1. Build plan.
2. Pass startup gates.
3. Start campaign.
4. Run cadence cycles.
5. Register incidents.
6. Generate growth reports.
7. Decide `continue/intervene/rollback`.

### Governance Rule

When policy text conflicts with runtime logic, runtime logic is binding until both are reconciled in the same change set.

## Role Model (Functional Naming)

| Role | Core responsibility | Required deliverables | Failure mode if missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Planner | Transform objectives into executable plans | Plan file, dependency graph, parallel waves | Work starts without structured scope |
| Requirements Analyst | Remove ambiguity and hidden blockers | Requirement-gap register, risk list | Rework and contradictory execution |
| Plan Reviewer | Validate execution and verification quality | pass/revise decision, revision notes | Unverifiable tasks enter production |
| Execution Manager | Dispatch, gate enforcement, rollback control | Cycle reports, dispatch log, incident response actions | Activity without controlled outcomes |
| Technical SEO Engineer | Technical reliability baseline | Technical QA reports, release checks | Index/render regressions destroy compounding |
| Intent Ops Specialist | Query intent and URL ownership | Ownership matrix, cannibalization board | Ranking instability and query overlap |
| Content Ops Manager | Dual-track throughput and content quality | Publish package, refresh package | Growth stalls or quality collapses |
| AEO Specialist | Extractable answer design | Answer modules, citation monitoring list | Weak answer-surface visibility |
| Schema & Entity Specialist | Structured data and naming consistency | Schema registry, drift checks | Extractability and trust decay |
| Internal Link Specialist | Topic graph and path continuity | Depth report, orphan report, bridge map | Discovery-to-conversion path breaks |
| Authority & PR Manager | Relevance-first authority acquisition | Target pool, outreach log, quality distribution | Competitive clusters plateau |
| Growth Analyst | Decision-quality metrics and experiment governance | Weekly dashboard, experiment conclusions | Misleading trends and wrong decisions |

## 1) Startup State: Mandatory Conditions Before Formal SEO + AEO Execution

### 1.1 Mission and Success Logic

Unified mission:

Build a compliant, compounding organic growth engine that increases non-brand visibility while improving high-intent pipeline contribution.

Success requires all three layers:

1. Visibility result: priority query clusters gain sustainable non-brand presence.
2. Quality result: high-intent engagement quality and intent matching improve.
3. Business result: measurable growth in MQL/SQL and assisted conversion from organic channels.

### 1.2 Preconditions for a 1M-Visit Goal

| Condition | Minimum threshold | Evidence requirement | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| Serviceable demand | Large enough category + query space | Query inventory and cluster size estimate | Sets hard traffic ceiling |
| Content throughput | Stable multi-cycle output capacity | 8-week throughput history | Enables compounding continuity |
| Technical stability | No recurring index/render regressions | Release QA + incident trend | Protects gains from technical erosion |
| Authority channel | Continuous relevance-first link opportunities | Target-domain pool and quality policy | Needed for high-competition clusters |
| Data trust | Reproducible weekly dashboard | Reconciliation notes + conflict protocol | Prevents wrong decisions |

If two or more conditions fail, downscope target range and run remediation before scale.

### 1.3 Team and Ownership Discipline

Rules:

1. Every task has one owner.
2. Every role has output and quality metrics.
3. Every unresolved dependency has an escalation owner.
4. No sprint item enters active state without rollback condition.

### 1.4 Compliance Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)

Forbidden:

1. Material mismatch between crawler-facing and user-facing content.
2. Fake structured data or unverifiable claims.
3. Any optimization that harms user clarity for ranking-only goals.

Allowed:

1. Extractable answer blocks.
2. Structured data tied to visible content.
3. Entity normalization and terminology consistency.

### 1.5 Data Stack Readiness

Minimum required data sources:

1. Technical diagnostics (crawl/index/render/performance).
2. Search performance data.
3. Analytics and conversion data.
4. Weekly operating dashboard.
5. Release-to-metric mapping log.

Data conflict policy:

1. Preserve both values.
2. Record timestamp and source.
3. Never silently overwrite.

### 1.6 Architecture and Query Ownership

Each priority query cluster must map to one and only one owner URL.

Mandatory artifacts:

1. Query cluster map with intent and funnel tags.
2. Query-to-URL ownership matrix.
3. Cannibalization register.
4. Information-to-commercial bridge map.

### 1.7 Startup Gates (`Go/No-Go`)

| Gate | Runtime key | Pass condition | Required evidence | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Strategy Gate | `strategy_gate` | `kpi_tree_bound=true` and `approved=true` | KPI tree and approval log | SEO Lead |
| Compliance Gate | `compliance_gate` | `documented=true` and `accepted_by_all=true` | Guardrail doc + team acceptance record | SEO Lead |
| Capacity Gate | `capacity_gate` | `rolling_weeks_feasible >= 8` | Throughput history for 8 weeks | Content Lead |
| Data Gate | `data_gate` | `dashboard_stable=true` and `reconcilable=true` | Dashboard refresh log + reconciliation notes | Growth Analyst Lead |
| Ownership Gate | `ownership_gate` | `priority_query_coverage >= 0.85` | Query ownership matrix coverage check | SEO Lead |

If any gate fails, scale execution is blocked by design.

## 2) Comprehensive SEO + AEO Execution System

### 2.0 Execution Order and Dependency Rules

| Tier | Modules | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Structural core tier | `technical_foundation`, `intent_operations`, `content_system` | Do not enter acceleration tier before structural stability |
| Performance core tier | `onpage_optimization`, `aeo_answer_layer`, `schema_entity_governance`, `internal_link_graph` | Improve extractability, relevance, and conversion continuity |
| Acceleration core tier | `authority_growth`, `experiment_engine`, `scale_loop` | Expand only when quality gates are healthy |

Dependency law:

1. Structural regressions pause acceleration activities.
2. Performance-tier deployment requires structural-tier green status.
3. Acceleration-tier investment requires positive or recoverable quality trend.

---

### 2.11 Global Quality Gates

| Gate dimension | Continue signal | Intervene signal | Rollback signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data trust | Dashboard stable and reproducible | Partial delays | Material conflict or data corruption |
| Technical health | No critical regressions | Frequent alerts | P0 technical outage |
| Compliance state | No conflicts | Ambiguous cases | Explicit violation |
| Business quality | Quality trends improve with scale | Quality flat | Volume up, quality down |

Decision principle:

1. Any rollback signal overrides continue signals.
2. Intervene is default when confidence is low.
3. Continue requires positive multi-track evidence.

---

### 2.12 Failure and Incident Protocol

#### Severity levels

- `P0`: critical. Immediate rollback path.
- `P1`: major. Mandatory intervention sprint next cycle.
- `P2`: moderate. Backlog remediation with active monitoring.

#### Mandatory incident record fields

1. Root cause summary.
2. Remediation actions.
3. Prevention updates.

#### Runtime behavior alignment

- P0 in current observation window forces `rollback` in cycle decision logic.

---

### 2.13 Source-Tier Governance

| Tier | Definition | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | Official policy and platform documentation | Highest |
| Secondary | Reproducible expert frameworks | Medium |
| Supplemental | Validated community/tool experience | Lowest |

Conflict rule: Primary always wins.

---

### 2.14 Team-Density Modes

| Mode | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Bootstrapped | Lower output, narrower cluster breadth, higher refresh ratio |
| Mid-market | Balanced dual-track operation with weekly experiments |
| High-capacity | Multi-market parallel execution with multi-lane experimentation |

---

### 2.15 Operating Rhythm

#### Weekly cycle

1. Gate and risk review.
2. Module dispatch and execution.
3. QA and publication checks.
4. Cadence decision output.

#### Monthly cycle

1. Cluster performance and decay review.
2. New-vs-refresh allocation rebalance.
3. Authority quality and technical debt review.

#### Quarterly cycle

1. Architecture and governance review.
2. Pattern retirement and codification.
3. Portfolio concentration adjustments.
